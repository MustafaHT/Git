# Git Basics

### Objectives
- Initialize a git repository in order to track changes.
- Create a new branch to isolate your changes.
- Place new or changed files into the staging area to prepare them for a commit.
- Remove files from the staging area before a commit.
- Commit new and changed files to a git repository.
----

## Why Git
Version control! As developers our code is our livelihood so it's important that we safely store our work... frequently. Not only that, we also want to track our changes as we make them. If we make a feature that ends up breaking the rest of our app we want to be able to go back to a point when our app was last working.

### Staging 
A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits. ... Separating staging and committing, you get the chance to easily customize what goes into a commit.
